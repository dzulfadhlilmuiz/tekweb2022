            <h1>Hobby</h1>
            <pre>
                Hobby is a recreational activity that is done in free time 
                to remember one's thoughts. Meanwhile, according 
                to the Big Indonesian Dictionary, Hobbies are nouns 
                that can be interpreted as hobbies; a special pleasure 
                in leisure time, not as a main job.
                Some of my hobbies are :
                    <h1>Playing Games</h1>
                With the development of the times, now there are 
                many types of games. Not only the type, the number 
                of people who have a hobby of playing games is also 
                increasing. In playing the game, strategy is the main 
                key to finish the game. So don't be surprised, if this 
                hobby becomes one of the hobbies that can increase 
                brain intelligence. In addition, there are several
                majors that can accommodate game playing skills. 
                Such as Visual Communication Design, Animation, to 
                Informatics Engineering. I also have a hobby of 
                playing games, I play several mobile games, namely:

                Exercise is a common thing and is often done every day. 
                Physical activity is often even associated with health. 
                Not only useful for physical health, exercise is also 
                said to improve a person's overall quality of life.

                    Futsal is a ball game played by two teams, each consisting of five people. 
                    The goal is to get the ball into the opponent's goal, by manipulating the 
                    ball with the feet. In addition to the main five players, each team is also 
                    allowed to have a reserve player. Unlike other indoor soccer games, the futsal 
                    field is lined, not a net or a board.
